# client-consultant-DatabaseProject
Database project completed with one other classmate for MIS 370 (Database Management Systems Design/Development) class at DePaul University in the Spring of 2023).

Project Guidelines:
The idea is to use the DB life cycle to develop a SQL database based on the problem.
Your job is to create a functional database that exemplifies good database design. The DB must be in 3NF. Each table must contain at least 10 to 15 records, except regions with 5. Create 10 reports in SQL. Your job is to create the
10 most useful and important reports a business manager needs to successfully
operate the business. They should be the type of reports used daily, weekly, or
monthly. The data you use will also serve to test the database and should be
appropriate. Your report could discuss scenarios you deem important. If you make important
assumptions, state them, but do not oversimplifying the problem. Your solution and
the assumptions you make should reflect reality.
